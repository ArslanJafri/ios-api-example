eeGeo 3D Maps iOS API Example
=============================

Example client for the Objective-C iOS bindings for the eeGeo SDK, a C++11 OpenGL-based library for beautiful and customisable 3D maps.

* This repo contains a project that exercises the eeGeo iOS API.
* The API is distributed via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/eegeo). Run 'pod install' to generate an XCode workspace.
* The example compares eeGeo maps with MapKit and Google Maps. You must sign up for an [eeGeo 3D Maps API key](https://www.eegeo.com/developers/apikeys/), and a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/signup) to use these maps. Add these keys to the app plist file.
* The API is continuously deployed; run 'pod update' to get the most up to date version.
* Pull requests accepted.
